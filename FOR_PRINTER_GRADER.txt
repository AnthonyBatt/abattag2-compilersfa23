Unresolved issues:
	- there is no removal of extraneous parentheses (didn't have time to implement)

	- It is not possible to have an if/else/for statement that isnt followed by curly braces in the printed version (it is fine in the parser and AST, but it will be printed back w/ { })
		Ex:
			Input:
			if (x) print ;
			x = 10;
			Printer Output:
			if(x)
			{
				print ;
			}
			x = 10;
		So it is represented properly in the AST I just dont print it back in the same manner

	- For some reason using a hexadecimal char code > 126 causes a segfault ('\0x7D' and above)
